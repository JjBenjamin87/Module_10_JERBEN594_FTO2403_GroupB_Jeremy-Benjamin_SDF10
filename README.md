## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

**APIs** allows components, programs and systems to communicate with one another,

* JSON.parse() is an example of an API.
* I have encountered Graphics APIs, like OpenGL before in video games.
* Transferring money from one bank to another is a way i've used an API.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An API is a group of definitions, tools and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with one another. APIs specify how software components should interact by using functionality of another without understanding how it works.

An interface is different because it is a boundary that two independant systems can cross to meet and interact with each other.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

API's three main components are:
* **API client** assembling and directs an API request .

* **API server** sends the correct endpoint on the API server for processing, it handles authentication, validating input data, retrieving or manipulating data from a database, and returning the appropriate response to the client

* **API response** the data or information that is returned from a server when an API request is sent, examples of common components:
    * **Body**
    * **Status code**
    * **Response headers**

* **API request** allows one application to request data or services from another application (in this example REST API request components are used):
    * **Endpoints** URLs where requests can be made.
    * **Parameters** additional data that is passed to an API endpoint to provide specific instructions for the API to process.
    * **Request headers** key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request or response.
    * **Method** defines the operation that the client would like to perform on the specified resource like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
    * **Request body** includes the actual data that is necessary to create, update, or delete a resource

 Types of APIs:
* **Web** a application programming interface for the Web. 
* **REST**  set of architectural constraints.

Favorite API:
* **Postmen** allows developers to integrate shipping and tracking functionalities into their applications or websites.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

   I have used Tailwind CSS.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

* **Confident** I feel confident in my understanding of APIs to a certain extent.
* **improvement** How I use and design with APIs.
